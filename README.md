# RenameViaHash
 
Reads all Bundle files in a folder and renames them based on a provided names.txt file which has a set of `FILENAME|ResourceName` entries. This used to be provided separately but it's included now because why not.

I intended to provide support for multiple resource names but don't think I ever implemented it. If building on this tool, that would be the first thing to do. I'd recommend rewriting from scratch though.

This was part of the original Bundle recovery toolset used to recover Burnout Paradise assets from a PS3 HDD image. It was used in conjuction with Bo98's bnd2_scanner and additional custom tools created by me in late 2020/early 2021. These tools have been replaced but this particular one can still be used at the end of the chain.
